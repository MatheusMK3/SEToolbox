#### This is a fork of the original version with updates to fix compatibility issues with newer versions of Space Engineers.
The [original version](https://github.com/midspace/SEToolbox) is no longer maintained since Midpsace has retired from working on SE Toolbox as of 2019-08-23 due to changes in the major game update containing Economy. This was after putting SE Toolbox into maintainance mode as described [here](https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/7402115/).

I am not taking over active development of SE Toolbox, only providing compatibilty fixes as they are needed.

[Download the latest version here](https://github.com/mmusu3/SEToolbox/releases/latest).

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/midspace/SEToolbox/wiki) for help using the application.
